                      Welcome to SpaceKids

    SpaceKids is the story of a brother and sister who live on the
    Moon with their grandfather, a famous space explorer. One day 
    Grandpa leaves to explore Earth. When he does not come back, 
    the SpaceKids fly to Earth to search for him. Along the way, 
    they discover a strange and wonderful world filled with fantastic 
    characters.

    SpaceKids is an interactive cartoon where you help the kids find
    their grandfather.  The story changes depending on your actions and
    decisions.  Every time that you play, you will see something new.

            way and a better way.

            The "good way" is to just launch it from the File Manager. The
            "better way" is to make your own SpaceKids Group and Icon.
            There are a lot of steps to make your own Group and Icon but
            it actually is quite easy and only takes a minute or two.

            To play using the File Manager:

                1. Double click the File Manager to open it.

    HOW TO PLAY:

    When there are arrows on the screen, you can use them to make things
    happen.

    Keyboard:  Press the key on the keypad that matches
               the arrow. For example, to use the up arrow,
               press the 8 key on your keypad. To use the
               down-and-right arrow, press the 3 key on your
               keypad, and so on.

    Mouse:   Move the mouse until the arrow you want to
               use is bigger than the rest and then click
               the mouse button.

    Joystick:  Move the joystick in the direction of the
               arrow that you want to use.  If the joystick
               doesn't seem to be working right, center the
               joystick and press "J".

    The small picture by the arrows shows what the arrows will
    control. If you see a "?" by the arrows, it means that you
    need to solve a special challenge before moving on.

    Press "S" to skip a scene.

    Hold "F" down to fast forward at double speed.

    Press the spacebar to pause the game. Press any key to
    continue.

    Press the Esc key twice to quit.

   Cheat Codes:
    
    * You can start the game part way into the story by typing
      "KIDS #" where # is one of the following numbers:

      1 - The Kids are ready to come out of the saucer.

      2 - Deet chooses between the Castle and the Bed.

      3 - Zeedle chooses between the Castle and the Bed.

      4 - Oliver the pencil is walking in front of Spike the cat.

      5 - Deet pulls on Spike's whiskers.

      As an example, "KIDS 2" (don't type the quotes) will start
      the game with Deet ready to choose between the Castle and
      the Bed.
